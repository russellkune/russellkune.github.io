My research interests are mainly centered around statistical and computational aspects of modern-day machine learning techniques, motivated by issues arising in genomic data. In particular, here are a few topics which I’m currently thinking about:

* **Applied probabilistic modeling** – I'm currently developing methods for analyzing sc-RNAseq data. I recently developed SCAN (supervised clustering and normalization) a model and inference procedure for normalization and clustering in single cell RNA sequencing experiments. 

* **Variational Inference for Discrete Structures** - I'm developing variational methods for Bayesian inference of tree topologies describing cellular differentiation from genomic data.
