My research interests are centered around developing computational methods for analyzing genomics data. In particular, here are a few topics which I’m currently thinking about:

* **Unsupervised Learning for Gene Expression Data** - I'm developing transfer learning approaches for integrating experimental and observational single cell RNA sequencing data.
* **Variational Inference for Discrete Latents** - I'm developing gradient estimation methods for stochastic gradient descent for discrete models  where the gradient of the evidence lower bound can't be tractably computed.
