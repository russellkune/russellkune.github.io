I'm Russell, currently a first year PhD student in [Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). 

Broadly, my research interests are in statistical methodology and machine learning for genomic data. See my [research](https://russellkune.github.io/research/) page for more information and recent publications. 

Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my undergraduate (BA) in [Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) and Mathematics at Harvard College.
