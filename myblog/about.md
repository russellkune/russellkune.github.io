I am an undergraduate student at Harvard studying statistics and mathematics, and graduating in 2019. My research interests are in causal inference, counterfactual learning, and machine learning for natural language.

I'm involved with data ventures, teaching the workshop series in the spring of 2018. I also spend a lot of time playing foosball
