Hi! Welcome to my website. I was not planning on having this be a blog, but haven't been able to figure out how to delete this section. Check out my "About" section! 


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Russell')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
